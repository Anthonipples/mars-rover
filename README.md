A small rover controller that functions by determining current position and updating a simple rover object in order to navigate through a plotted grid in a predefined fashion.

Refactored twice to convert as much conditional logic to polymorphism as possible. Still room for improvement. My OOP is a bit rusty

To run simply clone and double click index file. 
Choose which rover to run and observe output.

run console.log(rover) in JS console to observe final object.
