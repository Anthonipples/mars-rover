# Description: 
Basic Rover controller for predefind movement instructions.
Technology: 
JQUERY and Vanilla JS (Simple enough to not require any kind of framework)

Refactored twice to convert as much conditional logic to polymorphism as possible. Still room for improvement.

To run simply clone and double click index file. 
Choose which rover to run and observe output.

run console.log(rover) in JS console to observe final object.
